## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science student with a unique background in **Chemistry** and **Sterile Compounding Pharmacy**. After nearly a decade in the pharmaceutical industry, I returned to university to merge my domain expertise in healthcare with rigorous software engineering.

My passion lies in building **high-fidelity healthcare software** that bridges the gap between consumer wellness and clinical data standards. My toolkit ranges from high-level web frameworks to low-level graphics programming, allowing me to solve complex problems at any layer of the stack.

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** [WeightSmart Analytics](https://james-chase-prog.github.io/WeightSmart/) - An enterprise-grade health platform.
* 🌱 **I’m currently exploring:** Virtual Threads in Java 21 & Micro-Frontend Architectures.
* 💊 **Domain Expertise:** healthcare workflow optimization

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [🏥 WeightSmart Analytics](https://james-chase-prog.github.io/WeightSmart/)
> *A modular health ecosystem demonstrating Enterprise Architecture.*

**The Stack:** `Java 21` • `Spring Boot` • `Angular (Nx)` • `Kotlin (Android)` • `HAPI FHIR`

Most health apps are simple data loggers. WeightSmart is engineered as a **Digital Twin platform**, designed to ingest high-frequency health data while maintaining strict HL7 FHIR compliance for potential EHR integration.

**Key Engineering Highlights:**
* **Virtual Threads:** Leveraging Project Loom for high-throughput concurrency.
* **Medical Standards:** Native implementation of `Observation` resources via HAPI FHIR.
* **Security:** Stateless authentication using strict HttpOnly Cookie rotation.
