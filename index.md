## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science student with a unique background in **Chemistry** and **Sterile Compounding Pharmacy**. After nearly a decade in healthcare, I returned to university to merge my domain expertise in healthcare with rigorous software engineering.

My passion lies in building **high-fidelity healthcare software** that bridges the gap between consumer wellness and clinical data standards. My toolkit ranges from high-level web frameworks to low-level graphics programming, allowing me to solve complex problems at any layer of the stack.

* 🔭 **I'm currently working on:** [WeightSmart](https://james-chase-prog.github.io/WeightSmart/) - A full-stack health analytics platform (CS-499 Capstone).
* 🌱 **I'm currently exploring:** Offline-first sync architectures & adaptive data visualization.
* 💊 **Domain Expertise:** healthcare workflow optimization

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [🏥 WeightSmart](https://james-chase-prog.github.io/WeightSmart/)
> *A distributed full-stack health analytics platform — CS-499 Capstone.*

**The Stack:** `Java 21` • `Spring Boot` • `PostgreSQL` • `Kotlin (Android)` • `Room` • `Hilt`

WeightSmart evolved from a local-only Android monolith into a **distributed full-stack ecosystem** including a Spring Boot REST server with JWT authentication communicating with a Kotlin Android client featuring MVVM architecture, offline-first synchronization, and encrypted local storage across **80+ source files**.

**Key Engineering Highlights:**
* **MVVM + Hilt DI:** Consistent architecture across all 5 screens with StateFlow and Channel events.
* **Offline-First Sync:** 3-phase push/pull/cleanup protocol with WorkManager, delta sync, and tombstone-based soft deletes.
* **Algorithmic Intelligence:** Prefix Tree (Trie) for O(L) username search, Token Bucket rate limiting, adaptive downsampling for graph visualization.
* **Security:** JWT access/refresh tokens, Tink AES-256-GCM encrypted session storage, Spring Profiles secrets management, CORS, and rate limiting.
